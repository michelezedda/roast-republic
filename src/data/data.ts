Our coffee bar features an array of espresso and specialty drinks, along with direct trade pour overs, teas, and local pastries.",

    description:
      "We build partnerships with coffee farmers around the world to source high quality, specialty coffee beans helping them sustain and grow their businesses and support their families and communities. We then small batch roast the coffee here in LA and donate back a portion of our proceeds to nonprofits and causes we care about in our community. By helping people think slightly differently about something they consume every day, we believe we can do a lot of good together. \n \n Roast Republic was inspired by a friend of ours in Colombia who does a lot of humanitarian and missions work with people living in the dumps surrounding the city. He has a model where he launched a coffee roastery and several cafes around the city that helped supplement most of his community work. Not only did it fund his passion of helping people in poverty, but it also gave him an opportunity to connect with, and provide jobs for, people in the community. He seemed to create so much good with something so simple. Inspired by this, we came back to LA and began to dream about what it would look like to launch something similar here to support the non-profits we were passionate about, and create a lot of good in our community.",
